class Dataset(object):
    """A dataset.

    Dataset classes implement the interface to a particular dataset. The
    interface consists of a number of routines to manipulate so called
    "state" objects, e.g. open, reset and close them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sources : tuple of strings, optional
        The data sources to load and return by :meth:`get_data`. By default
        all data sources are returned.

    Attributes
    ----------
    sources : tuple of strings
        The sources this dataset will provide when queried for data e.g.
        ``('features',)`` when querying only the data from MNIST.
    provides_sources : tuple of strings
        The sources this dataset *is able to* provide e.g. ``('features',
        'targets')`` for MNIST (regardless of which data the data stream
        actually requests). Any implementation of a dataset should set this
        attribute on the class (or at least before calling ``super``).

    Notes
    -----
    Datasets should only implement the interface; they are not expected to
    perform the iteration over the actual data. As such, they are
    stateless, and can be shared by different parts of the library
    simultaneously.

        ----------

        A dataset can be asked to provide only a subset of the sources it

        labels). A dataset can choose to use this information to e.g. only
        load the requested sources into memory. However, in case the
        performance gain of doing so would be negligible, the dataset can
        load all the data sources and then use this method to return only
        those requested.

        Parameters
        ----------
